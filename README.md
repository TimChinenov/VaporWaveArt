# VaporWaveArt
The following code Vaporwaves an image. This code is purely artistic and has no other purpose. 

To run the code, run main.py in a python shell. A image should appear. If you click ESC, the image will close. Clicking any other key will refresh the image. 

To change the image being used, navigate to vaporwave/__init__.py and change the path on line 10.

#Requirements
numpy==1.16.2
opencv-python==4.0.0.21

To use this code, download it and all of its folders. The program relies on the images in the folder "elements" and the 
haar cascades in in the folder "cascade". The repo contains a set of sample images that I found to work fairly well.
